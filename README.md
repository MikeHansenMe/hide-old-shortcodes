hide-old-shortcodes
===================

This plugin hides unregistered shortcodes from being shown in the content. 

It has a log located at Tools->Hide Old Shortcodes so you can view the shortcodes that were hidden. You can then choose to view the shorcode in the edit screen, allow the shortcode to be viewed in the content, or remove the shortcode.
